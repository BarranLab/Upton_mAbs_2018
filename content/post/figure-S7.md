## Figure caption

<sup>DT</sup>CCSD<sub>He</sub> plots for fully glycosylated (intact), partially deglycosylated (endo S2 treated) and fully deglycosylated (PNGase F treated) IgG1 mAbs (charge state range 22+ to 25+). Data fitted with Gaussians (cumulative fit plotted) and normalised against (IMS area fraction) x (MS peak height fraction). Width of shading around each peak denotes the standard deviation calculated, n=3.
