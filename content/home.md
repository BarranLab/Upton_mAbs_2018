[Figure 4](https://upton-herceptin-2019.netlify.app/assets/figure_4.html): Deuterium uptake difference plots for heavy chain (HC) intact vs. endoS2 treated Herceptin速; endoS2 - intact. Each bar represents a different peptide (HC sequence coverage = 70.2 %, 55 peptides). Blue bars represent the deuterium uptake differences for Herceptin速 lot C; orange bars represent deuterium uptake differences for Herceptin速 lot A.

[Figure S2](https://upton-herceptin-2019.netlify.app/assets/figure_s2.html): Mass spectra for Herceptin速 (a) fully glycosylated (intact), (b) following endoS2 treatment (truncated glycans) and (c) following PNGase F treatment (fully deglycosylated).

[Figure S3](https://upton-herceptin-2019.netlify.app/assets/figure_s3.html): Mass spectra for the NIST mAb standard (a) fully glycosylated (intact), (b) following endoS2 treatment (truncated glycans) and (c) following PNGase F treatment (fully deglycosylated).

[Figure S4](https://upton-herceptin-2019.netlify.app/assets/figure_s4.html): Mass spectra for the IgG1 Fc-hinge fragment (a) fully glycosylated (intact), (b) following endoS2 treatment (truncated glycans) and (c) following PNGase F treatment (fully deglycosylated).

[Figure S7](https://upton-herceptin-2019.netlify.app/assets/figure_s7.html): DTCCSDHe plots for fully glycosylated (intact), partially deglycosylated (endo S2 treated) and fully deglycosylated (PNGase F treated) IgG1 mAbs (charge state range 22+ to 25+). Data fitted with Gaussians (cumulative fit plotted) and normalised against (IMS area fraction) x (MS peak height fraction). Width of shading around each peak denotes the standard deviation calculated, n=3.

[Figure S9-12](https://upton-herceptin-2019.netlify.app/assets/figure_s9-12.html): Collision energy activated IM-MS heat map of the IgG1 NIST mAb and mAb lot A-C with (a) glycans, (b) truncated (endoS2 treated) glycans and (c) no glycans. Mass selected 24+ charge state with collision voltage range 4-200 V, n=3.
